# AI Edit Patterns Documentation

This document tracks the different AI editing approaches used during Task 3 development.

## Chat-Based Edits (Multi-file Coordination)

### Prompt Example 1: Initial Page Scaffolding
**Context:** Creating the poll detail page structure
**Prompt:** "Create a dynamic route /polls/[id] page that displays mock poll data with question and options"

**What it handled well:**
- Created proper Next.js dynamic route structure
- Set up basic component layout with TypeScript
- Included mock data structure for testing

**Areas it missed:**
- Initially used Server Component when Client Component was needed for state
- Didn't include proper form submission handling

### Prompt Example 2: Navigation and Routing
**Context:** Adding poll list to dashboard with navigation
**Prompt:** "Update the polls dashboard to show a list of mock polls that users can click to navigate to individual poll pages"

**What it handled well:**
- Added proper navigation structure
- Created consistent UI with existing dashboard
- Used router.push() for navigation

## Inline Edits (Focused Refinements)

### Inline Edit 1: Vote Submission Logic
**Context:** Enhancing handleSubmit function
**Selected Code:** The handleSubmit function in poll detail page
**Prompt:** "Replace mock console.log with actual Server Action call and proper error handling"

**What it handled well:**
- Integrated Server Action properly
- Maintained existing error handling pattern
- Preserved loading state logic

### Inline Edit 2: Authentication Integration
**Context:** Adding user authentication checks
**Selected Code:** Form submission section
**Prompt:** "Add user authentication check before allowing vote submission"

**What it handled well:**
- Used existing useAuth hook pattern
- Added proper error messages for unauthenticated users
- Maintained form validation flow

### Inline Edit 3: State Management Enhancement
**Context:** Adding vote tracking and results display
**Selected Code:** Component state and conditional rendering
**Prompt:** "Add hasVoted state to show results page after successful vote submission"

**What it handled well:**
- Created clean state transitions
- Added proper results visualization with percentages
- Included back navigation to dashboard

## Server Action Creation

### Server Action: Vote Submission
**Context:** Creating reusable vote submission logic
**Prompt:** "Create a Server Action for vote submission that handles both Supabase and demo mode"

**What it handled well:**
- Followed established pattern from polls.ts
- Included duplicate vote prevention
- Used proper error handling and revalidatePath

## Key Observations

### Chat Edits Strengths:
- Excellent for multi-file coordination and scaffolding
- Good at understanding overall architecture and routing
- Effective for creating consistent UI patterns across components

### Chat Edits Limitations:
- Sometimes suggests patterns that conflict with established rules
- May not always choose optimal component type (Server vs Client)

### Inline Edits Strengths:
- Perfect for focused functionality improvements
- Great for integrating with existing patterns
- Excellent at maintaining code style consistency

### Inline Edits Limitations:
- Limited context for cross-file dependencies
- May miss broader architectural implications

## Rule Compliance Analysis

The AI editing patterns followed our established rules:

**Followed Rules Successfully:**
- Used Client Components when interactivity was needed
- Implemented Server Actions for data mutations
- Used shadcn/ui components consistently
- Included proper loading states and error handling
- Followed naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Added proper TypeScript types

⚠️ **Areas for Rule Enhancement:**
- Need clearer guidance on when to use Server vs Client Components
- Should specify mock data patterns for development
- Could add more specific voting logic patterns

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with Chat Edits** for scaffolding and multi-file changes
2. **Use Inline Edits** for focused enhancements and bug fixes
3. **Refer to Rules** consistently to maintain patterns
4. **Iterate** between both approaches as needed
5. **Test frequently** to catch issues early
